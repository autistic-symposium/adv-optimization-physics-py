Numerical Methods are fun!
==========================

This repository contains the source code and homework for many examples of numerical methods and exercises for Physics and Astrophysics (from the graduate class taught by Prof. Mike Zingale at Stony Brook University):

- Integration and Differentiation: numerical derivatives, error estimates, Simpson's rule.

- Ordinary Differential Equations: Eulder and Euler-Cromer methods, Verlet method.

- Linear Algebra and FFTs: time series for the damped driven pendulum, matrix inverse,  conditional number.

- Advection and Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations: implicit advection, Lax Wendroff, non-linear hyperbolic equations.

- Elliptic Partial Differential Equations.

- Computational Fluid Dynamics: Rayleigh-Taylor Instabilities.
